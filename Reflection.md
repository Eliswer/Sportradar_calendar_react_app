### AI Usage Summary – SportRadar React Calendar

During the development of the SportRadar calendar, AI tools like ChatGPT and Cursor were mainly used to assist with understanding, explaining, and improving code readability, as well as helping identify and fix minor bugs. 
All logic, structure, and implementation were done manually. AI was primarily used to explain to clarify best practices, gain deeper insights into how certain parts of the code work, expand my knowledge of React hooks, and better understand backend flow.

## AI suggested and assisted with:

- Using `Array.from` for efficiently creating empty arrays in loops.
- Fixing a form issue where the submit button was placed outside the form element, which caused the `required` attribute to stop working — this was done with Cursor IDE, since it has direct access to my codebase and can automatically detect such structural issues, unlike ChatGPT.
- Generating clear `JSDoc` comments to improve code readability and prevent misunderstandings.
- Improving the `useEffect` logic for fetching data and assigning colors to events.
- Explaining and refining backend code, since I’m still learning and building experience in that area.
- Suggesting the use of `$` for styled-component props (like `$hasEvent` and `$eventColor`) so React doesn’t render them as HTML attributes and avoids related warnings or errors.

Overall, AI served as a supportive tool for learning, explanation and optimization, all functionality was manually implemented and reviewed.
